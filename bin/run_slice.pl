/*  connectome-strata — the runner (strata arm of the Wave 3 granularity experiment).

    Ticks the reentrant cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop for N laps and
    prints the narrated, glass-box trace. The BEHAVIOUR is held constant with the
    Wave 2 slice and the atomic and loops arms — only the pack boundaries differ
    (here, one pack per Causalontology stratum). Because all three regions are
    co-stratal (brain regions, ordinal 9), their three ticks live in the ONE
    region_stratum pack as internal sections; the runner spawns one cyclic_actor
    per region on those internal ticks. The regions coordinate ONLY through the
    Lattice, via numbered phase cues and lattice_await/notify — stigmergy for
    state, notification for reactivity, zero actor-to-actor references, no
    busy-poll. When the loop comes to rest the runner PROVES it closed. Exit 0 on
    a clean, proven run.

    Usage:  swipl ... bin/run_slice.pl -- <NLaps> <EventLap> <Rate>
