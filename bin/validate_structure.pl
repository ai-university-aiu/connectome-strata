/*  connectome-strata — the Causalontology 3.0.0 structure validator.

    Assembles the same twenty-eight records from the FIVE STRATUM packs that each
    mint the constructs at their level (macromolecular, cellular, synaptic,
    region, community), then validates every record against PrologAI's UNMODIFIED
    Causalontology 3.0.0 conformance engine:
      - co_validate_schema/4  — the record satisfies its kind's JSON schema.
      - causal_core_validate_semantics/3 — the local semantic rules hold.
      - the cortisol CRO classifies as SKIPPING with NO skip-gap (skips:true) —
        note that this skip spans TWO stratum packs (community owns the CRO and
        reaches down to macromolecular for the effect occurrent).
      - the signed provenance assertion VERIFIES (Ed25519).
    It writes each record to structure/<name>.json. Exit 0 iff every check passes.

    Like the atomic arm (and unlike loops), the region_stratum pack co-locates
    structure records WITH the runtime, so importing it drags in the Lattice —
    the validator must have library(lattice) on its path (see LEDGER.md).
