# check_layers.sh — run PrologAI's UNMODIFIED strict-layer-rule construct
# (library(layer), Ledger entry L4) against THIS arm's eight packs.
#
# The strata arm is the sharpest test of the layer construct's relationship to the
# DATA layer: each pack is a Causalontology stratum, and the pack layer(N) is set
# to track the stratum ORDINAL rank. This checker loads PrologAI's library(layer)
# by its real path (no copy, no modification) and calls its directory-scoped
# report + check against the arm's packs/ dir, reusing the SAME construct through
# its public layer_report_dir/1 and layer_check_dir/2 predicates.
#
# Exit 0 = clean (no upward edge among declared packs); 1 = a violation;
# 2 = could not run.
