/*  connectome-strata (Wave 3c, the strata arm) — neurochemistry (Layer 1): the NATIVE DYNAMICS, reused verbatim from the Wave 2 slice.

    The GROUNDING RULE says: ground the STRUCTURE in Causalontology 3.0.0, but
    keep the DYNAMICS native. This pack is the dynamics. None of it is a
    causal_relation_object or any other Causalontology record: a rate constant,
    a reward-prediction-error, and a plasticity increment are numbers evolving
    in time, and forcing them into a content-addressed structure record would
    be a category error. So dopamine kinetics, cortisol tone, and the
    three-factor plasticity rule live here as ordinary Prolog arithmetic.

    DOPAMINE is the reward-prediction-error (RPE) signal: the difference
    between the reward actually received and the reward the cortex predicted.
    It is the THIRD FACTOR that gates plasticity — without it the rule would be
    plain Hebbian coincidence detection; with it, the synapse learns only in
    proportion to surprise.

    CORTISOL is the slow glucocorticoid tone. Biologically a chronic-stress
    cortisol elevation suppresses corticostriatal plasticity; here it enters
    the three-factor rule as a multiplicative suppression factor, giving the
    hormone a real dynamical effect on top of the structural layer-skip the
    causal_map pack records.

    This pack is a pure LEAF: it imports no other slice pack, because the
    dynamics are self-contained arithmetic. The regions above it (Layers 2-4)
    import IT — those are the downward edges the strict layer rule permits.
