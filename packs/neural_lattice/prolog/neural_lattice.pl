/*  connectome-strata (Wave 3c, the strata arm) — the neural Lattice substrate (Layer 0), reused verbatim from the Wave 2 slice.

    This pack is the slice's realisation of the CLOSURE RULE: STIGMERGY FOR
    STATE plus NOTIFICATION FOR REACTIVITY. Regions coordinate only through a
    single PrologAI Lattice nexus. They never address one another: a region
    posts a numbered PHASE CUE (phase_0, phase_1, phase_2 — a positional slot
    number, exactly the spike's "set only a NUMBER, never name who picks it
    up") and awaits its own phase cue with lattice_await/5, woken by the
    lattice_notify/1 that every Lattice write performs. There is no busy-poll:
    a region blocks on a private message queue until a write wakes it.

    Exactly one phase cue exists at any instant (each region TAKES its cue when
    it acts, then POSTS the next slot's cue), so the ring is deterministic and
    only one region is ever active — which is why the glass-box narration reads
    as a clean sequence even though three region threads are alive.

    The pack also carries the glass-box TRACE: the ordered record of every hop
    the token makes, printed live and retained so the runner can PROVE the loop
    closed (3N+1 hops, strictly monotonic token, cortex re-entered N times).

    This pack imports only PrologAI's library(lattice) — an external dependency,
    invisible to the slice's own layer graph — so its declared layer(0) has no
    intra-slice upward edge to violate.
